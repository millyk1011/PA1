What went well:I successfully used dictionaries as the primary data structure to organize the full year’s schedule, including 7 Mods and 3 D Block seasons. I was able to use error handling to prevent impossible schedules. Flowchart and inline comments improved the clarity of the program logic for both myself and others reading the code.

What as a challenge: Ensuring proper input validation was tricky, especially preventing users from adding duplicate classes in the same Mod or incorrect D Block seasons, but I was able to make it work well. Managing dictionaries for Mods and D Blocks, particularly when checking for empty values or updating specific blocks, was sometimes confusing.

What would have made it better: Refactoring the main() loop and nested input logic for even cleaner flow.Implementing additional features such as a daily schedule view would have made the program more useful.

More time to work: I would add enhanced features such as daily schedule views, or more class data. I could refine the user interface for smoother interaction, including better input prompts and clearer error messages.
